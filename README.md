Blox Fruit Executor is a focused tool for Roblox scripting. It runs Lua scripts in Roblox games and offers a stable runtime, low overhead, and a clear API for automation. The project targets users who create scripts for Blox Fruits gameplay and other Roblox experiences. The tool aims for consistent performance, robust injection, and a clean UI for executing scripts.

First run
- Open the executor.
- The UI shows a list of scripts, a code editor, run/stop buttons, and a log panel.
- Use the Attach button to connect to Roblox.
- Use the Open button to load a saved script.
- Use Run to execute.

Attaching to Roblox
- Start Roblox.
- Join a game.
- In the executor, click Attach.
- The UI lists active processes. Select RobloxPlayerBeta.exe or the name that matches the client.
- Click Attach. The runtime injects and reports status in the log.

Basic commands
- Run: Execute current script.
- Stop: Stop current execution if the runtime supports interruption.
- Clear Log: Clear the log window.
- Save: Save script to disk.
- Open: Load a script from disk.
- Bind Key: Open a dialog to assign a hotkey to the current script.

User interface elements
- Script list: Shows saved scripts and snippets.
- Editor: Simple Lua editor with line numbers.
- Log: Shows print output and errors.
- Control bar: Run, Stop, Attach, Settings.

Usage examples (simple)
- Print a message
```lua
print("Hello from Blox Fruits Executor")
```

- Teleport to a position (example API call)
```lua
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
player.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = CFrame.new(0, 100, 0)
```

- Loop that logs a counter
```lua
for i = 1, 10 do
  wait(0.5)
  print("Counter:", i)
end
```

Scripting API (overview)
The executor exposes helper functions to simplify common tasks. The API is a small set of Lua functions that wrap common game operations. These helpers aim to reduce boilerplate. Use them in your scripts as needed.

Common helpers
- bf.wait(seconds) — sleep without blocking the UI thread.
- bf.notify(text, duration) — show an on-screen message (if supported).
- bf.getNearestEnemy(range) — returns the nearest NPC or player within range.
- bf.useAbility(id) — triggers a game ability by id.
- bf.autoFarm(target) — simple automated farming routine.
- bf.stopAutoFarm() — stops auto farm routine.

Example: Auto attack loop
```lua
local bf = require("bloxfruits_helpers") -- example require path

bf.autoFarm({
  range = 30,
  attackDelay = 0.8,
  targetPriority = "boss"
})
```

Script templates
- Auto farm
  - Use the autoFarm helper with tuned parameters.
- XP grind
  - Move between known spawn points and kill targets.
- Teleport utility
  - Bind keys to teleport to saved markers.
- Ability spam
  - Cycle abilities with a given delay.

Advanced tips
- Use small scripts. Keep tasks modular.
- Reserve heavy loops for controlled routines.
- Use bf.wait instead of raw loops to avoid high CPU.
- Test new scripts in a private server or local session.
- Log state changes. Use print with clear tags to debug.

Performance tuning
- Avoid expensive loops. Insert waits.
- Cache remote references where possible.
- Use local variables for repeated access.
- Limit global lookups by storing functions in locals.

Troubleshooting
- If the executor fails to attach:
  - Check Roblox is running.
  - Ensure you run the correct binary from Releases.
  - Restart the executor and Roblox.
- If scripts crash:
  - Check the log for error lines.
  - Add print statements to isolate the issue.
  - Validate object paths before using them.
- If injection fails on recent client updates:
  - Download the latest release from Releases.
  - Check the changelog for compatibility notes.

Logs and diagnostics
- The log panel contains:
  - Timestamped entries.
  - Print output from scripts.
  - Error stack traces.
  - Injection status messages.
- You can export logs to a file for later analysis.

Development notes
- The project uses a mixed codebase:
  - Native injector module in C++.
  - Lua runtime integration.
  - Renderer and UI in a cross-platform toolkit.
- The native module handles process attachment and memory mapping.
- The Lua module wraps runtime functions and registers helper functions.
- The UI provides the editor and log windows.

How it works (high level)
- The injector locates the Roblox process.
- It injects a small runtime payload.
- The runtime creates a Lua context and registers helper functions.
- The UI sends scripts to the runtime for execution.
- The runtime executes Lua in the context of the target process.

Design constraints
- Limit global modifications to avoid interfering with the target process.
- Keep the runtime small.
- Provide clear logs and diagnostics.
- Make the UI simple and direct.

Extensibility
- Add plugins by placing Lua files in a plugins folder.
- The executor scans the folder on start and exposes plugins in the UI.
- Plugins can register commands and hotkeys.

Configuration file
- Default config: config.json
- Example config fields:
```json
{
  "autoAttach": false,
  "startupScripts": ["startup.lua"],
  "hotkeys": {
    "run": "F5",
    "stop": "F6"
  },
  "logPath": "./logs"
}
```
- Edit the file and restart the executor.

Hotkeys
- Open settings and assign hotkeys.
- You can bind run/stop and script slots to keys.
- The UI shows the current bindings.

Persistence
- Save scripts in the scripts folder.
- The executor auto-loads scripts from that folder.
- Use a consistent naming scheme to keep scripts organized.

Script storage
- Scripts save as .lua files.
- The executor can export a workspace to a ZIP for sharing.

Sample scripts repository
- Keep a folder named samples with organized examples.
- Use clear names and short comments in scripts.

Testing and QA
- Run a script in a private session to check behavior.
- Use debug prints to find logic errors.
- Test edge cases like missing objects, slow loads, or network lag.

Contributing
- Clone the repository.
- Create a topic branch for your changes.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Add tests when you change the injector or runtime.
- Document new API functions in the README.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of changes.

Developer notes
- The injection core lives in src/injector.
- The Lua helpers live in src/lua.
- The UI code lives in src/ui.
- Use the build scripts in tools/ to build on Windows.
- The project uses a unit test runner for runtime functions.

Example workflows
- Quick run
  1. Launch executor.
  2. Attach to Roblox.
  3. Paste a script in the editor.
  4. Press Run.

- Persistent bot
  1. Place bot.lua in the startupScripts list in config.json.
  2. Enable autoAttach in config.json.
  3. Launch executor, then launch Roblox.

- Development loop
  1. Edit helpers.lua in src/lua.
  2. Build runtime module.
  3. Replace runtime in the release build.
  4. Test with a small script.

Best practices for script authors
- Comment your code.
- Use safe checks:
```lua
if game and game.Players and game.Players.LocalPlayer then
  -- safe to proceed
end
```
- Avoid global side effects.
- Use controlled loops:
```lua
local i = 0
while i < 10 do
  i = i + 1
  bf.wait(0.5)
  print(i)
end
```

Sample script pack (example content)
- startup.lua
```lua
print("Startup script loaded")
bf.notify("Executor ready", 3)
```
- farm_simple.lua
```lua
local bf = require("bloxfruits_helpers")
bf.autoFarm({range = 50, attackDelay = 1})
```

Integration with editors
- You can edit scripts in external editors and save to the scripts folder.
- The executor monitors the folder and can auto-reload scripts if enabled.

Localization
- The UI supports multiple languages via locale files.
- Add a locale file in locales/ and restart the executor.

Binary verification
- Release assets include checksums. Verify the checksum after download.
- Keep the integrity of your build artifacts by matching checksums.
